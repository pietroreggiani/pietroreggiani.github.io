**"Climate Change Expectations: Evidence from Earnings Forecasts"**

*I study the effects of changes in climate change expectations on forecasts of cash flows of public firms.
    I use data on financial analysts' forecasts of firm earnings, and local temperatures as shifters of their 
    perception of climate change. 
     Analysts experiencing warmer temperatures tend to issue more pessimistic forecasts.
    The effect is correlated with firm exposure to both regulatory and physical climate change risks.
    The sensitivity of forecasts to temperatures is more negative for carbon-intensive industries, while for firms in the renewable sector the effect has an opposite, positive, sign.
    The negative effect is related to firm exposure to physical climate risks as well, especially for some risks such as hurricanes and storms. 
    This effect is amplified for analysts that directly experience extreme weather events, consistently with a mechanism related to the salience of climate change. 
    Exploiting forecasts issued for different future horizons, I pin down the timing at which climate risks are expected to materialize.
    The reaction of forecasts to temperatures is concentrated in horizons between eight and ten quarters in the future.*

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <i>A central tenet of economic theory is that market power induces deadweight loss. This claim rests on an assumption that is difficult to verify empirically. Namely, that dominant firms produce less than the social optimum. I provide evidence of such restrictive behaviour using a rich dataset of Norwegian hydropower firms. The research design exploits exogenous variation in market power, arising from transmission bottlenecks and the formation of localized electricity markets. The unique production traits of hydropower production further helps to avoid empirical complications associated with marginal cost estimation and endogenous variation in the supply mix. This allows me to identify the causal impact of market power on firm behaviour in a reduced-form setting that requires minimal assumptions. I show that gaining pivotal status can cause firms to withhold production by as much as a two to five percent. My results suggest that even nominally competitive markets are susceptible to strategic manipulation and welfare losses.</i>
